# AntiTechnoMapProSandOfGold
Try to get spectator almost as possible, detect when map is or is not and only.


Let me retrive what distinguish the both maps and what differenciate them, they are not so far together but sands are more and more.


This achieve theses opportunities:
 - Stop the checks and cancelations, can prevent any change or detect if they are needed or not, example select or not ready
 - Detect the map and get alerted and unspecced automatically, same apply but not for statuses


So for the abstract of all of this, the program springlobby will be verified to get its checkboxes always checked in a good order:
 - Be specced always.(and never start game as spec)
 - Be spec or not but be ready(and btw unspecced before) on certains maps, not on others.(and never start game as spec)
 - Be never specced and always ready and check always auto unspectate if checkbox is checked.(but not start game if user is specced)
