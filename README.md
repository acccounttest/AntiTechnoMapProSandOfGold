# AntiTechnoMapProSandOfGold
Try to get spectator almost as possible, detect when map is or is not and only.


Let me retrive what distinguish the both maps and what differenciate them, they are not so far together but sands are more and more.


This achieve theses opportunities:
 - Stop the checks and cancelations, can prevent any change or detect if they are needed or not, example select or not ready
 - Detect the map and get alerted and unspecced automatically, same apply but not for statuses, there are:
 + Promap: detect a map with blue in it
 + Antimap: detect keyword techno without case but inaccurate since it relay on UI sync so the last map you joined but not always.


So for the abstract of all of this, the program springlobby will be verified to get its checkboxes always checked in a good order:
 - Be specced always.(and never start game as spec)
 - Be ready on blue and green maps, be spec on tekno maps ,be unready on all others maps only after first map change.(map lists can be changed or deactivated)
 - Be spectator and check always auto unspectate.(but not start game if user is specced) and be ready as soon as player is unspectated.
 - Always spec and always start the game
