# AntiTechnoMapProSandOfGold
Try to get spec almost as possible, detect when map is or is not and only


Let me retrive what distinguish the both maps and what differenciate them, they are not so far together but sands are more and more.


This achieve theses opportunities:
-Stop the checks and cancelations, can prevent any change or detect if they are needed or not, example select or not ready
-Detect the map and get alerted and unspeced automatically, same apply but not for statuses
