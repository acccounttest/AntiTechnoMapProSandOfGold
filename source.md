   + > If you want the source code, you just have to unzip the executable, the source is in a folder in a single text file at : 
    -  * .rsrc/RCDATA/>AUTOHOTKEY SCRIPT< *
    -  If you want add/change the icon add this:
    -  ```autohotkey
    Menu, Tray, Icon, C:/Users/sph/Documents/AHK/start/CTMend.png, 1, 1```

 + > Paste it in a new autohotkey file.
 + > Remember this version was compiled with **AHK 1.1 Unicode 64 bits**, not the version 2 or AHK_L, try simply get the
     executable from the autohotkey website, during the installation maybe the option utf8 will be proposed,
     i had no such option during my AHK installation(no need with the executable) because it is a little bit
     older on other platforms, but recently under windows 10 there is an option for utf8, idk what could be the
     result on this OS with or without the beta utf-8 implemented into the system.
